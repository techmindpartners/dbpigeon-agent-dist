 ## Project Overview
 **dbpigeon** is a Rust-based database monitoring agent designed to collect and
 analyze database metrics. The project aims to follow Rust best practices with a
 focus on safety, performance, and reliability while providing a scalable
 solution for database monitoring operations.
 .
 Here are the key architectural features of the project:
 .
 ### Modular Design
 - Separate modules for collection, monitoring, export, and configuration
 - Uses a plugin-based architecture for database engine support
 - Currently focused on PostgreSQL with plans for MSSQL and MongoDB support
 .
 ### Configuration Management
 - Uses TOML-based configuration
 - Supports multiple monitoring targets
 - Configurable logging levels and monitoring intervals
 - API configuration for data export
 .
 Sample configuration:
 ```toml
 [agent]
 api_base_url = "https://api.dbpigeon.com"
 api_key = "[your_api_key]"
 log_level = "[debug, info, warn, error]"
 high_frequency_interval = [10, 30, 60] # default 10 secs
 medium_frequency_interval = [60, 120, 300] # default 1 min
 low_frequency_interval = [600, 900, 1800] # default 10 mins
 .
 [targets.server1]
 platform = "[self-hosted, aws, gcp, azure, huawei, heroku]"
 db_engine = "[postgresql, mssql, mongodb]"
 db_host = "[hostname]"
 db_port = "[port]"
 db_username = "[username]"
 db_password = "[password]"
 db_name = "[database_name]"
 ```
 .
 ### Monitoring System
 Implements three monitoring frequency tiers:
 - High Frequency (10s): Critical metrics, active sessions
 - Medium Frequency (1m): Table stats, index usage
 - Low Frequency (10m): Schema configuration, system metrics
 .
 ### Async Architecture
 - Built on `tokio` async runtime
 - Implements concurrent monitoring operations
 - Uses async/await for I/O operations
 - Employs thread pools for parallel execution
 .
 ### Data Export
 - RESTful API-based data transmission
 - Implements compression and batching
 - Includes retry mechanisms with backoff
 - Secure authentication system
 .
 ### Error Handling & Logging
 - Comprehensive error handling using Rust's Result types
 - Configurable logging system with dynamic log levels
 - Structured logging for better observability
 .
 ### Graceful Shutdown
 - Signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
 - Controlled shutdown sequence
 - Ensures data preservation during shutdown
 .
 ### DataFlow Diagram
 - The following diagram illustrates the data flow within the agent:

 ### Docker Build
 ```bash
 docker build -t dbpigeon-agent:latest -f Dockerfile .
 ```
 ```bash
 docker run -d \
   --name dbpigeon-agent \
   -e CONFIG_FILE="/app/examples/self-hosted-target.toml" \
